Assignments of the Udacity MOOC Deep Learning

This repository contains the assignments I have done during the [Udacity MOOC on Deep Learning with Google][udacity-deep-learning]. The course is free but there is no support expect if you register to a [nanodegree program][udacity-nanodegree]. That's why I'm sharing my homeworks with as much comments as possible, you may find them useful.

The course is just great! You will use and develop neural networks for image recognition with convolution, natural language processing with embeddings and character based text generation with RNN/LTSM.

See below an outcome of one of the assignments, a t-SNE projection of word vectors, clustered by similarity.

## Quick start

From the repository root, start the Notebook server with ``jupyter notebook``.
